# ML_Homework
Homework from Machine Learning Applied class at University of California Riverside 


Week 1 This folder is just handwriten solutions to algebra homework that was due the first week. Nothing really interesting happening there 


Week 2 



Week 3 - Buffon Needle Problem. Run Montecarlo simulations to estimate pi based on the number of needles in each run 


Week 4 -Project is to build up a classiÔ¨Åer that can distinguish number 9 from every other numbers and measure performance (reusing code and libraries are ok ) 
        Find the 9s using K-Nearest neighbours for Minkowski metric of order (1, 2, 3).
        Find the 9s using Decision tree.
        Find the 9s using Random Forests.
Week 5 - Find the income using Support Vector Machines - First - run a random forests and measure  performance.
