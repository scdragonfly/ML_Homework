# ML_Homework
Homework from Machine Learning Applied class at University of California Riverside 

Week 1 This folder is just handwriten solutions to algebra homework that was due the first week. Nothing really interesting happening there 

Week 2 
Week 3 - Buffon Needle Problem. Run Montecarlo simulations to estimate pi based on the number of needles in each run 

Week 4 -Project is to build up a classiﬁer that can distinguish number 9 from every other numbers and measure performance (reusing code and libraries are ok ) 
        Find the 9s using K-Nearest neighbours for Minkowski metric of order (1, 2, 3).
        Find the 9s using Decision tree.
        Find the 9s using Random Forests.
        
Week 5 - Find the income using Support Vector Machines - First - run a random forests and measure  performance.

Mid Term - Wine quality problem . Understanding and explaining the data set.
        2. Processing data, cleaning up.
        3. Dividing your data into a training and test set.
        4. Choosing the relevant algorithm /Writing a python code to perform learning. (reuse every code from the lectures)
        6. Evaluating your learning performance / Making sure your results does not depend on your choosing parameters.
        
Final Project - Neural Networks 
Use diﬀerent activations, number of layers, number of neurons at each layer, compare their performance and ﬁnd the simplest neural net. There could be couple of networks that are fairly close in terms of the performance choose anyone you think has the least complexity and explain your reasoning.
